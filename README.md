# Age Made Simple: `age_made_simple`

## Summary

`age_made_simple` is a Python package for a person's age processing. Basically for now, this program defines an `AgeCalculator` class with methods to calculate the age of a person and determine the day of the week the person was born, based on the provided date of birth. It takes user input for the date of birth, performs the calculations, and prints the results.

This program is part of practicing of my skill in Packaging Python Projects and making it publicly available of both GitHub and the Python Package Index (PyPI).
